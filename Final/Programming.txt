a) A module is a separate software component that serves as a container for subroutines and variables. Since it is defined
outside of the main program, it can add functionality to multiple programs when called and allows the user to solve complex
problems in more manageable sections.  

b) A subroutine is a sequence of instructions that is defined in a program. It is stored as a unit that accomplishes specific
tasks. Subroutinees are useful because they are user-defined functions that can be called multiple times within the same 
program to avoid having to rewrite the same chunk of code.

c)A reference or pointer is a variable that holds the location in memory of a piece of data, rather than the data itself.
