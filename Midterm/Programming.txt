a. Strongly typed languages require the user to explicitly declare data types when defining variables.
Loosely typed languages, on the other hand, do not require the user to be as specific about the data types.

b. A stack is a data structure in which the last element in is the first element out.  Elements are added and removed from the same
end of the chain of information. For example: the push/pop command in perl.
A queue is an ordered data structure in which the first element in is also the first element out. Elements are added and 
removed from opposite ends of the chain of information.

c. 
10 = 00001010
128 = 10000000
00001001 = 9
00101010 = 42
